Wasan
from "Pastoral: To Die in the Country"
What do they do in the next world
All the lost children?
The ones who are abandoned
The ones who are killed
Their eyes forever filled with tears
They haul their heavy stones
What do they do in the next world
With their bleeding hands
Beside the dried up river
Ceaselessly
They build a tower which rises up
Like a prayer into the skies
"A stone for my father,
A stone for my mother,
Another for my country
And who's the next one for?"
