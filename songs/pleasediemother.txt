Please Die, Mother from "Jashumon"
Translation by Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei
Shi-ba, sa-ba , ba-te-n.
Is there a reason? Lilies
And painted tigers,
A snowy wasteland.
And a sea lion
Ma-sa-e.
The discovery of -
What if? An arrow, or -
A-ra, da-ra, ni.
A-B-C-D
E-F-G
H-I-J-K-L
Letters of the alphabet, scattered.
Blood, earth, breasts, milk, genitals
Drinking blood and milk
Omnipotence:
God, hair, a paper-cutting scissors, a long-horned beetle,
A false tooth, black.
And the dead babysitter's
Panpipe flute.
Festival music,
Flower madness,
Crying, crying,
Mother,
I'm going to abandon you.
Please die, Mother.
Please die, Mother.
Please die, Mother.
