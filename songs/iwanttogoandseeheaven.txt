I Want to Go and See Heaven from "Jashumon"
Translation by Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei
It's something like revenge, this thing called heaven.
My father was a drunk,
My mother was a gambler.
I used to cry in the fields
Whenever I saw a train passing.
I want to go and see heaven,
I want to go and see heaven.
My brother was a suicide,
My sister ran away.
I jumped on a freight train
And my life began.
I want to go and see heaven,
I want to go and see heaven.
My first lover
Worked on the railroad.
Just a hometown boy
Who got drunk, and slept with me, and left me.
I want to go and see heaven,
I want to go and see heaven.
My second lover,
Was a truck driver
Who promised we would wed,
But he died in a traffic accident.
I want to go and see heaven,
I want to go and see heaven.
