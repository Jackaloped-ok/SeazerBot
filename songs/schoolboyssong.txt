School Boy's Song from "Jashumon"
Translation by Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei
If you're raped,
It's all right to cry.
If cryingâ€™s not enough,
It's all right to want revenge.
If wanting revenge is not enough,
It's all right to kill someone.
If you do kill someone,
It's all right to run away.
Facing the setting sun,
You laugh wildly.
A single thrust of the dagger
Up your filthy cunt
And it's all over.
If you're raped once,
It's all right to be raped again.
If you find the rapist,
It's all right to strip naked
In front of his eyes.
Strip until he runs away,
Then chase him.
That's one way
To stay alive.
