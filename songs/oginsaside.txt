Ogin's Aside from "Jashumon"
Translation by Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei
Where to? Where to? Where to? Where to? (Kill!)
Come back, come back, come back, come back (Scold!)
Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful, pitiful (Fear!)
Woman, woman, woman, woman (Passion!)
Alone, alone, alone, alone (Escape!)
The somersault
Of a fatherless child,
A sparrow
From an unknown country.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaach (Kill!)
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaach (Scold!)
Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful, pitiful (Fear!)
Woman, woman, woman, woman (Passion!)
Alone, alone, alone, alone (Escape!)
The somersault
Of a fatherless child,
A sparrow
From an unknown country.
Where to? Where to? Where to? Where to? (Kill!)
Come back, come back, come back, come back (Scold!)
Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful, pitiful (Fear!)
Woman, woman, woman, woman (Passion!)
Alone, alone, alone, alone (Escape!)
