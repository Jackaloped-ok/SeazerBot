Begging Forgiveness from "Jashumon"
Translation by Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei
Songs inhabit the land of my birth,
But flowers there are none.
Along the road, a pilgrim to the sweltering city,
My body, blown by the autumn winds —
My body, which lives to travel —
But the winds are blowing another way
And incense there is none.
The winds of more than twenty autumns,
The winds of more than twenty autumns.
Without lust and suffering, salvation there is none.
Without worldly corruption, paradise there is none.
Now do I humbly take my leave,
Begging forgiveness, oh beloved Father,
Begging forgiveness, oh beloved Mother,
For I am a faithless, unfilial child,
A faithless, unfilial child.
Begging forgiveness, oh beloved Father,
Begging forgiveness, oh beloved Mother,
For I am a faithless, unfilial child,
A faithless, unfilial child.
Somewhere in Tokyo, from temple to temple
I wander, a pilgrim with breaking heart,
Hiding at dusk in the city where cherry blossoms fall.
Hiding at dusk in the city where cherry blossoms fall.
Hiding at dusk in the city where cherry blossoms fall.
Tokyo pilgrimage — a tale of flowers.
Tokyo pilgrimage — a tale of flowers.
Tokyo pilgrimage — a tale of flowers.
