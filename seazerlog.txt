ERROR, TOO LONG:
These are the lines:
「消滅!」
Note from Julie Kersten:
I was following the lyrics to Internal Clock, Municipal Orrery and they reminded me of something.  Perhaps someone already mentioned this, but I think they're describing the Astronomical Clock of Prague (Czech Republic).  I visited it when I was in college on a study abroad program.  This verse in particular really fits it.
